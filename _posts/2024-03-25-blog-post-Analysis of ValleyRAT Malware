Dynamic Analysis of Window’s Based Malware using Reverse Engineering: A Case Study of Exmatter (Cont.)

Abstract
Because malware is always evolving, malware analysis is a necessary yet difficult task. Numerous malware variations damage system resources or take them captive in exchange for ransom demands. Trojans are among the most sought-after by attackers because of their capacity to inflict immediate harm and implant further malware payloads on targets. This research proposes a system for the dynamic analysis of Trojan malware through staged code execution in a regulated virtual environment. Various stages of the framework's code are analyzed using open-source technologies. This study's investigation focuses on finding Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), which are strings that indicate suspicious behavior, and the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of the malicious Windows software Exmatter malware. 

Key words: Dynamic malware analysis, static malware analysis, reverse engineering, .NET SDK libraries.

1)Introduction

Malware, sometimes referred to as malicious software, is any application or file created with the intention of causing harm to a server, network,or computer. Trojan horses, worms, spyware, ransomware, and computer viruses are examples of malware. This malicious software alters or hijack necessary computer operations, steals, encrypts, and deletes sensitive data, and keeps track of end users' computer activity . Going over the different types of malwares can help you understand the complexity of the current landscape. The process of malware analysis primarily occurs in an isolated virtual malware environment. One must propagate the process of capturing the malware using different types of techniques available for use in the malware analysis approach. This pertains to both the intent of malware and its application. The categories include viruses, botnets, ransomware, fileless malware, worm trojans, and droppers. Every malware has a unique way of operating. Trojan horses are malicious programs that spread other viruses by disguising themselves as other, trustworthy-looking code. When the Trojan reaches the victim's computer, it unpacks and inserts the code, which takes control and damages the victim's device. One example of malware, or Trojan, is Exmatter. Exmatter malware is a clickjacking type of malware that can be advantageously utilized to inject harmful payloads via files to obtain access to sensitive data belonging to any company and attempt to change it. the victim's machine by shutting it down and destroying it entirely, in addition to extracting as much data is possible from the system. Using a native API like RtlGetVersion, Ex Matter can acquire the OS version number. Additionally, the AlphaFS (Alpha Leonis).NET library's Native Methods class, which has numerous Windows APIs, is utilized by its routine. AlphaFS simulates Win32 file system features. Like System.IO, but supporting advanced NTFS features. Due to its self-destruction processing, the Ex-matter malware makes it more challenging for investigators to track its path.Before the ransomware is really installed on the victim's network, Exmatter was made to steal file types from several pre-selected directories and upload them to a server under the control of the attacker. The tool's developers continued to tweak it to optimize its operation and expedite the exfiltration of a sufficient volume of high-value data in the shortest amount of time, so that even at the time of its discovery, multiple variants were observed. The number of file types that Exmatter tries to exfiltrate has been lowered in this most recent version. Only files with the following extensions will now be exfiltrated by it:
File extensions:.pdf,.doc,.docx,.xls,.xlsx,.png,.jpg,.jpeg,.txt,.bmp,.rdp,.txt,.sql,.msg,.pst,.zip,.rtf,.ipt,.dwg
Additional malicious  file extensions(FTP protocol):-
Including In former versions, there was a third exfiltration capability (FTP) to SFTP and WebDav. There are two distinct protocols for maintaining and sharing files across a network: SFTP and WebDAV. Here is a quick rundown of each:
1.SSH File Transfer Protocol, or SFTP: The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which is used for secure remote login and command execution, is extended by SFTP. SFTP offers a dependable and safe way to send files over an encrypted SSH connection between a client and a server. It has functions including file permission management, directory listing, and file transfer resume. In several sectors, such as finance and healthcare, where secure file transfer is crucial, SFTP is extensively utilized.
2.Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning, or WebDAV: WebDAV is an addition to the HTTP protocol, which is utilized for data transmission over the Internet. Internet wide. Users can manage and edit files on remote web servers together thanks to WebDAV. Features like property management, versioning, and file locking are included. Wikis, other web-based collaborative platforms, and content management systems are common uses for WebDAV.
To summarize, WebDAV is an HTTP protocol extension that facilitates collaborative file management and editing on distant web servers, whereas SFTP is a secure file transfer protocol that runs over an encrypted SSH connection. Although they are widely utilized in many different industries and applications, the two protocols have different uses. The use case are as follows:-
a)Reports: Possibility of creating a report with a list of all files that were processed.
b)Eraser: Processed files may get corrupted (not enabled in the version examined).
c)Self-destruct: A configuration option that, if enabled, causes the program to shut down and self-destruct when run outside of a Windows domain or in a non-corporate environment.
d)Support for Socks5 was discontinued.
e)GPO was used to deploy the tool in at least one attack.
Furthermore, the malware underwent a significant rewrite, with even its preexisting functions being implemented in a different way. This could have been an attempt to evade discovery. It is unclear if Exmatter was developed by Coreid or a knowledgeable associate of the organization, but when combined with two distinct versions of Coreid's Ransomware is a noteworthy phenomenon. The group's concentration on data theft and extortion is further highlighted by its ongoing evolution, which highlights the significance of this aspect of attacks to ransomware perpetrators today.

3) Malware Analysis

Malware analysis is an essential step in the process of finding and characterizing the existence and characteristics of malware in cyber security. It is sometimes the responsibility of security specialists to ascertain if a suspicious file is malicious or not. It is crucial because it allows responders to filter out false positives and assess the severity of a malware epidemic. Analyzing malware is useful both in advance of and during an incident. Malware analysis locates and categorizes the malware to offer helpful information during an occurrence. Malware analysis allows you to locate and log the infection, providing you with a wealth of information that can assist thwart future attempts. The malware analysis data is incorporated into the lessons learnt after the occurrence. Newly examined malware teaches analysts about patterns, attack methods, and behavior. We will examine both static and dynamic malware analysis techniques. Static analysis examines the malware code without running it. The executable code is displayed in this type of examination without requiring the application to be run by using pertinent tools. However, dynamic analysis must be carried out if the static analysis is unable to yield enough details about the malware. When performing dynamic malware analysis, the malware is run and its actions inside the computer environment are monitored to see how it behaves. Planning and preparation are essential because the malware's operations can damage the host system. To prevent harm to the host system, dynamic analysis is typically carried out in a virtual environment. The third A hybrid technique is used for malware analysis. Hybrid analysis uses a combination of static and dynamic analysis approaches to evaluate malware. For example, whereas dynamic analysis can be used to watch malware behavior in real time, static analysis can be used to identify possible dangers. Since hybrid analysis provides a thorough understanding of a sample's behavior as well as its code, it is typically considered the most successful form of malware analysis. Malware analysis can be done in two major ways: dynamically and statically. on dynamic analysis, the malware is executed on a virtual machine or other controlled environment, and its activity is monitored while it runs. This method can assist in determining the functions and goals of the malware and offers useful insights into its activity.  In contrast, static analysis examines the malware code without running it. With this method, one can gain a better knowledge of the malware's fundamental structure and potentially spot exploitable flaws or vulnerabilities. Some typical methods for analyzing malware are as follows:
1) Code analysis : the process of looking through the malware's code to determine how it works and behaves.
2)Behavior analysis: the process of tracking the actions of the malware when it runs in a safe environment.
3)Memory analysis: looking at the malware's memory footprint to determine its behavior and operations;
4)network analysis: tracking the malware's interactions with other systems and devices to learn how it disseminates and gathers data.
Because malware analysis offers vital information that may be utilized to thwart future assaults, it is a crucial component of cybersecurity. Security researchers and organizations can create new defense techniques and tools to fend against malware by knowing how it operates. Furthermore, malware analysis can assist in determining the origin of an attack, which can be useful data for businesses and law enforcement organizations trying to stop such assaults in the future.

4)Proposed methodology
























Figure 3 illustrates the process flow of malware analysis and shows the standard strategy that is suggested

Malware analysis for.NET malware entails a methodical approach to analyzing its behavior and code to comprehend its possible effects and functionality. First, disassemblers or decompiles are used to analyze the malware's binary to extract the source code or representation in an intermediate language. This makes it possible for analysts to understand the algorithms and logic that the malware uses. Next, the malware's runtime behavior—including its interactions with the system and network—is observed using dynamic analysis techniques like sandboxing and debugging. This aids in spotting malicious activity related to network interactions, file manipulation, and registry changes. Furthermore, the malware's structure and metadata are examined using static analysis techniques, which also help to spot potential exploits and indicators of compromise (IOCs). As the analysis progresses, specialists to extract useful insights and ultimately support the creation of efficient detection signatures and mitigation measures to counter the danger posed by the.NET malware, tools and skills are employed. In this process flow diagram for performing malware analysis for a .NET malware we can use tools like ghidra, ida pro, cutter, ILspy, dnSpy. Etc. and many more tools can be used. The decompilation can be done on Microsoft visual studio community edition.

5)Results and Discussions

                                                                    Fig 3 -  SSH packet hooking

The act of intercepting and modifying Secure Shell (SSH) packets while they are being transmitted over a network is known as SSH packet hooking. Attackers attempting to gain unauthorized access to private data or systems frequently use this strategy. Attackers may try to get passwords, carry out commands, or introduce malicious payloads into the communication channel via intercepting SSH packets. Network devices such as switches, routers, and even hacked hosts are susceptible to packet hooking. Attackers may employ specialized instruments or scripts, like packet sniffers
or man-in-the-middle (MITM) assaults, to intercept SSH communication.

 
                                                         Fig 4 – Packet overwrites (buffer underflow)

A network security vulnerability known as packet overwrite occurs when an attacker modifies packet data to replace information that already exists in a packet. This can result in a few harmful effects, like changing control flags in the packet header, manipulating payload information, or changing the destination or source IP address. Attackers use vulnerabilities in packet overwrite to perform a variety of attacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) assaults, packet injection, and session hijacking. Attackers can interfere with network traffic, get around security measures, or run arbitrary commands on target systems by altering packet contents. Network administrators should use intrusion detection systems (IDS) to identify and stop unusual packet activity, traffic filtering, and robust network segmentation to reduce the danger of packet overwrite attacks.


 

Fig 5 – String payload (command injection using regex values)

Creating input strings that match patterns defined by regular expressions (regex) is the process of creating string payloads using regex values. Web application security testing frequently uses these payloads, particularly for input validation and injection threats. An attacker could, for instance, create a string payload for a SQL injection attack that matches a regex pattern used for input validation. This would allow the attacker to get over client-side validation and take advantage of flaws in server-side code. In a similar vein, attackers may employ regex payloads in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks to circumvent detection systems or input filters and insert malicious scripts into websites. Developers should put strong input validation and sanitization procedures in place on both the client and server sides to ward against such attacks.


 
Fig 6 – AES Encryption (hash impersonation)

The symmetric encryption algorithm known as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is frequently employed to protect data. When used appropriately, AES is immune to assaults; but, when combined with subpar key management or cryptographic implementations, it can become vulnerable to attacks. Hashing impersonation is one possible attack vector in which a hacker tries to take advantage of flaws in the hashing technique used in AES implementations. With a hash function impersonation, an attacker can modify input to cause a collision—a situation in which two distinct inputs result in the same hash value. This collision could result in several security flaws, such as the capacity to pass for legitimate data or evade authentication procedures. Use of strong hash functions and adherence to appropriate key management procedures are essential for mitigating such attacks.

 
Fig 7 – bypassing proxy password

Usually, exploiting holes or weaknesses in the proxy server's setup is how a proxy password is bypassed. Several techniques, including brute-force assaults, misconfiguration exploits, and the use of known flaws in the proxy software, can be used to accomplish this. Credential brute-forcing is a popular technique in which an attacker repeatedly tries various username-password combinations until they discover the right one. This technique is dependent on users' or administrators' usage of default or weak passwords. Exploiting incorrect proxy server configurations is another technique. Inadequate logging and monitoring, improperly configured authentication methods, or lax access controls could all make it possible for an attacker to get around the proxy password without authenticating. To mitigate follow the MSDN docs entra protection to safeguard your data.

Fig 8 – Exploit for SSH key hooking (GetHashCode)

This C# code defines a struct called ‘Struct9’ and a class called ‘Class40’. Now let us dissect the code:
 1.{Class40}:
- It has two private static arrays: one for bytes, called `byte_0}, and the other for strings, called `string_0}.
- `static Class40()` is a static constructor that initializes `byte_0} with an array of 12,091 (0x2EFB in hexadecimal) bytes and `string_0} with an array of 791 (0x317 in hexadecimal) empty strings.
- The hash code of an instance of `Struct9} is set as the first element of `byte_0} within the static constructor.
2. {Struct9}: - The code defines a struct type, but it does not supply its members.
Let us now discuss the possible weakness in this code: 
Vulnerability to Security: It is the line "byte_0[0] = (byte)new Struct9()" that is vulnerable .GetHashCode();. It is attempting to  initialize an instance of ‘Struct9’s hash code as the first element of `byte_0.Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that `GetHashCode()` will behave in a secure or surprising manner, particularly if `Struct9} does not override the `GetHashCode()` method. An attacker could be able to take advantage of the hash code's predictability.Potential security flaws like hash collision attacks or the nefarious use of predictable hash codes may result from this. 
In order to lessen this risk: 
- Should hash codes be required, make sure they are created correctly in a random and safe way, perhaps by overriding the `GetHashCode()` function in `Struct9’.

 
Fig 9 – Exploit for Username enurmeration using public key authentication (PublicKeyAlgorithm)

The following are the weaknesses in the code:
1.Injection Vulnerabilities: To obtain the username, the code calls the `requestMessage.get_Username()` method. This approach may be susceptible to injection attacks, such as SQL injection or command injection, if the input is not being properly validated. 
2. Buffer Overflow: The code stores and processes data, including the {username} variable, using byte arrays. These byte arrays may be subject to buffer overflow attacks if they are not appropriately sized and inspected.
3. Inadequate Input Validation: The code uses functions like `SshData.WriteBinaryString()’ and `SshData.Write()` to write different kinds of data to a buffer. These techniques may be subject to XSS and CSRF attacks if insufficient input validation is done. 
The following are some countermeasures for the possible vulnerabilities found in the code:
1. Injection Vulnerabilities: You should check all input data, including the username, in order to reduce injection vulnerabilities. Libraries or frameworks for input validation can be used to make sure the data is in the correct format and is free of dangerous code.
2. Buffer Overflow: You should appropriately size and validate all byte arrays before utilizing them to guard against buffer overflow attacks. Secure coding techniques, including input validation and bounds checking, can be used to make sure that the byte arrays do not grow larger than they are supposed to.
3. Inadequate Input Validation: All data written to the buffer should have enough input validation performed on it to thwart attacks like XSS and CSRF. Libraries or frameworks for input validation can be used to make sure the data is in the correct format and is free of dangerous code.


 
 Fig 10 – Remote path injection

Vulnerability’s such as Remote Path Injection (RPI) allow attackers to run arbitrary code or obtain unauthorized access to a system. RPI happens when a program or service takes user-supplied URLs or file paths without properly validating or sanitizing them. Attackers can get around security measures or introduce malicious code to take advantage of this vulnerability.
Use these recommended procedures to reduce RPI vulnerabilities:
1. Carry out appropriate input validation: User-supplied input data, including file paths and URLs, should always be validated. Libraries or frameworks for input validation can be used to make sure the data is in the correct format and is free of dangerous code. 
2. Put file path sanitization into practice: Before using user-supplied file paths, always sanitize them. You may utilize the file Use frameworks or path sanitization libraries to make sure that the file paths are free of dangerous characters or code to ensure its safety.

b)Agent Tesla Malware Results


 
Fig 11 – Main function

Malicious software, or malware, primarily aims to gain unauthorized access or cause harm to a target system or device by infiltrating it. Malware can have many distinct purposes and behaviors, but some typical ones are as follows:
1. Unauthorized access: To enter a target system, malware frequently takes advantage of flaws in operating systems, applications, or hardware. This can be accomplished in several ways, including by using weak passwords, phishing attempts, and software flaws.
2. Running malicious code: After the virus has successfully penetrated the target system, it will run a specific malicious code that can do several different things, like encrypting files for ransomware, stealing confidential information, or initiating a denial-of-service attack.


 
Fig 12 – UnhookWindowsHookEx vulnerability

A security flaw known as the UnhookWindowsHookEx vulnerability occurs when a program uses the UnhookWindowsHookEx API call to unhook a global hook (such WH_KEYBOARD or WH_MOUSE). Malicious actors may be able to take advantage of the application's vulnerability if it is unable to correctly unhook the global hook.
The following information relates to this vulnerability:
a)Vulnerability: An application may keep the hook method in place if it is unable to correctly unhook a global hook using the UnhookWindowsHookEx API function. Malicious actors may take advantage of this vulnerability and use the hook technique to do a variety of nefarious tasks, such stealing confidential information or inserting malicious code.
b) Mitigation:  mitigation strategy is for applications to make sure that they When global hooks are not needed, unhook them correctly.


 
Fig 13 – Private implementation (0x2F9 and 0x2C90 vulnerable endpoints)

The SAP NetWeaver vulnerability CVE-2022-22535 is caused by inadequate user input encoding, which can result in unauthenticated code injection. The private implementation of the endpoints 0x2F9 and 0x2C90, which are normally exposed via the network, is impacted by this issue. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may give an attacker access to private information like user IDs and passwords, which could have a partial impact on the application's confidentiality. This vulnerability's primary cause is inadequate user input validation and sanitization, which leaves open the possibility of an attacker infecting the system with malicious code. An attacker would have to make a specially crafted request to one of the affected endpoints to take advantage of this issue. There would be harmful code in the request that is not adequately sanitized or verified by the program, giving the attacker the ability to run any code on the target system.


 
Fig 14 – IAsyncResult vulnerable driver

The Microsoft Windows TCP/IP Driver has a buffer overflow problem that is connected to vulnerability CVE-2021-21559. The IAsyncResult object, which is used by the driver to control asynchronous activities, is vulnerable. When the driver neglects to appropriately verify the size of a buffer used in an IAsyncResult action, a buffer overflow happens. An attacker can take advantage of this weakness by targeting the compromised system with a specially constructed network packet. The buffer overflow may occur if the packet is handled by the weak driver, which would give the attacker access to run arbitrary code on the system. This vulnerability is important because it can be used by an unauthorized attacker over the network. If this vulnerability is successfully exploited, remote code execution may result, which can lead to the impacted system being completely compromised.

 
Fig 15 – winapi intptr vulnerable endpoint

The Microsoft Windows operating system has the Windows API method {SessionCreate`, which facilitates the creation of a new session object for user session management. If this function is not implemented or secured appropriately, it may be open to exploitation.This is a synopsis of the function Several parameters are entered into the function:
1. {pszSessionName}: A Unicode string containing the session name.
2. {pszProfilePath{: The path to the user's profile is specified by this Unicode string.
3. The path of the provider's DLL is indicated by the Unicode string "pszProviderPath{."
4. The name of the provider's DLL is specified by the Unicode string {pszProviderDll{.
5. {dwFlags}: An 32-bit variable that indicates which flags should be utilized when creating a new session.
6. {dwReserved{: A 32-bit value set aside for potential usage in the future.
An integer pointer (intptr\_t) to the recently formed session object is the function's return value. When input parameters are not checked correctly, there is a chance that the `SessionCreate` method will include vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to craft a malicious request to the vulnerable endpoint. Numerous issues could arise from this, including remote code execution, privilege escalation, and unauthorized access. It is crucial to adhere to secure coding principles, such as input validation, output encoding, and appropriate access control, in order to reduce these vulnerabilities. Regular penetration tests and security assessments can also aid in locating and addressing any possible weaknesses in the system. To sum up, the function `SessionCreate` If not adequately guarded, vulnerabilities in the Windows API may be exploited. To avert possible attacks, developers should take the required safety measures to verify input parameters and put in place appropriate access controls.

 
Fig 16 – Allocation function vulnerable drivers

Memory on the stack is allocated with the help of the `stackalloc` keyword. Using `stackalloc`, a 29-byte buffer is allocated on the stack in an given formt. In this case, the vulnerability associated with `stackalloc` is not a direct flaw in the code itself, but rather a possible problem with how `stackalloc` is used generally. The primary issue with `stackalloc` is that if the allocated buffer size is more than the stack space that is available, it may result in stack overflow. This may occur when the code is run in a context with insufficient stack space, like a recursive function or a thread with a tiny stack size, or when the buffer size is incorrectly determined. An Crashing, corrupted data, and even uncontrolled code execution can result from stack overflows when attacker-controlled data overwrites the stack. It is advised to take the following actions to lessen the possible vulnerability associated with stackalloc:-
1.Verify that the allocated buffer size is accurately computed and does not surpass the available stack space.
2. To avoid buffer overflow vulnerabilities, use appropriate memory management and bounds checking techniques.
3. Steer clear of utilizing {stackalloc` in situations when there isn't much stack space available, like recursive functions or threads with tiny stack sizes.
4. Use appropriate error checking and exception handling to deal with situations where the stack space is full.
5. If the allocated memory is not sufficient, think about using different memory allocation techniques like the `Marshal.AllocHGlobal} function if there is a limited amount of stack space available, a big buffer size is anticipated.
Note: The above-mentioned `stackalloc} vulnerability is a possible problem that could occur from using `stackalloc` generally. In order to precisely detect and evaluate vulnerabilities associated with {stackalloc{, the code should undergo a comprehensive security analysis and penetration testing.
